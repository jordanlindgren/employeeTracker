# employeeTracker

Description
I have created a command line application that allows uses to interact any several ways with their employee database. Users can create a list of all departments, all roles, and all employes. It allows them to add a new department, role, or employee. Additionally, users can update an employee's role using the application.

This application requires Node and users should run "npm install" in their command line prior to use. In addition, use the schema.sql file to build your initial database prior to using the command line tool.

Usage
After installing Node and running "npm install" users will open their command line and initiate the program by typing "node index.js".
Then choose an option according to your needs. Picture of first question in the command line
